/*
How could you go about leveraging queries in these parts of a personal organizer
app: contacts, appointments, tasks, and e-mail?

If an emergency were to come up to cause a day to not be available for
tasks and appointments, I could use a query to find all items for that day
and send them a message that I will not be able to be there.

If I had a lot of contacts, I could search for all contacts with a birthday
today and wish them all happy birthday.

I could look up all of my tasks with the keyword "urgent".

I could access all @hotmail.com e-mails to let them all know that every
e-mail I am sending is bouncing back.
